\chapter{Introduction}
\section{Motivation}
Twitter has become an important communication channel in times of emergency. The ubiquitousness of smartphones enables people to announce an emergency they’re observing in real-time. Because of this, more agencies are interested in programatically monitoring Twitter (i.e. disaster relief organizations and news agencies). But, it’s not always clear whether a person’s words are actually announcing a disaster. The aim is to predict which Tweets are about real disasters and which one’s aren’t.

During Natural Disasters on Social Media," 2015 IEEE/WIC/ACM International
Conference on Web Intelligence and Intelligent Agent Technology (WI-IAT),
Singapore, 2015, pp. 17-20.
They do a case study on what the intention and profile of these fake message senders
could be. They use multiple approaches, flat and hierarchical. In flat approach they classify
based on Random Tree classifier using 10 fold validation. In hierarchical approach they do
the flat approach followed by another round of classification on category of fake like spam
etc}

Detection on Twitter," 2018 IEEE/ACM International Conference on Advances in
Social Networks Analysis and Mining (ASONAM), Barcelona, 2018, pp. 274-277.
They use a weakly supervised learning with SVM, neural network etc as learning
methods. They use source data along with data in some cases to classify the tweets.
Results show a F1 score of 0.9}

They conduct a survey on existing algorithms for detecting spam or fake news on
social media from data mining perspective. They describe the various types datasets and
metrics that can be used to measure the efficiency of these algorithms.}

Machinery, New York, NY, USA, 797–806.
They propose the use of deep learning model such as recurrent neural networks for
detecting fake news.They try to find a general way to solve the fake news issue instead of
site specific or format specific ones that exist.}

\section{Problem Statement}
During disasters many fake tweets are sent to create a panic in the
minds of people. Identifying these news/tweets and removing them
before they spread is a necessity to maintain proper order in society.

\subsection{Objectives of the Project}
The aim is to predict which Tweets are about real disasters and
which one’s aren’t. The dataset is obtained from kaggle competition.
We are given a set of labelled tweets and we have to do a binary
classification.

\chapter{Conclusions and Future Work}
Both supervised and unsupervised models seem to perform well but are not better
than many other models and methods used in the kaggle competition.
As we proceed i will implement a ensemble of these methods, an ensemble of
ensembles, some other methods like RNN, adaboost will be tried out. So that it
becomes a comprehensive survey of algorithms that can be used to solve these
kind of problems.
